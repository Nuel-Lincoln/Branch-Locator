# Branch-Locator
An improved Bank branch locator solution api that maps closest branches to the Customer's location depending on the availability of the service required by the customer in that branch... 

This solution is was developed using asp.net, no authentication or authorization was included, you get to implement that yourself

The address of your server or database should be added to the program.cs file.

For quick usage of this solution, simply perform an api-db migration, but first of all you will have to delete the Dbcontext in the solution name MainBranchLocatorDbContext
